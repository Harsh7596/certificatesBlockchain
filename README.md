SkillCredentialing Smart Contract
Vision
The SkillCredentialing smart contract is designed to provide a decentralized and tamper-proof system for issuing, managing, and verifying digital certificates for completed courses. By leveraging blockchain technology, this project aims to offer a transparent and immutable solution that enhances trust and efficiency in credentialing processes.

Project Features
Certificate Issuance: Issue digital certificates for completed courses using a unique hash to ensure authenticity.
Certificate Revocation: Revoke certificates if needed, with a transparent record of the revocation event.
Certificate Verification: Verify the validity of a certificate by checking its status on the blockchain.
Event Logging: Emit events for certificate issuance and revocation to facilitate easy tracking and integration with external systems.
Future Scope
Enhanced Metadata: Extend the Certificate struct to include more detailed metadata such as course descriptions, grades, and issuer details.
Role-Based Access Control: Implement role-based access control to ensure only authorized entities can issue or revoke certificates.
Integration with Educational Platforms: Develop integrations with educational platforms for automated certificate issuance upon course completion.
User Interface: Create a web-based or mobile user interface to interact with the smart contract, providing a more user-friendly experience for issuing and verifying certificates.
Tokenization: Explore the possibility of tokenizing certificates for additional functionality such as transferable credentials or rewards.
